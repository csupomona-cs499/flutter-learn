## L1: Flutter Dev Setup

Goals:

1. Setup the Flutter development environment
2. Run the first sample app in an Android emulator



### 1. Install Flutter SDK

The official guide documents the basic setup process in details. Plese check out the following link:

> Flutter Get Started Guide: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

The first step is to download the Flutter SDK.

### 2. Setup Your IDE

Please follow the guide here [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor) to setup the IDE. I recommend Android Studio, but if your computer is too slow, you could also run VS Code and see if that works any better.

Finally, please make sure you have the following things done:

1. Install Android Studio 
2. Install Flutter Plugin in Android Studio
3. Create and open a new Flutter Project
4. Install Android SDK (use Android 9 or above)
5. Install Android Emulator

### 3. Run Your First Flutter App using an Emulator 

If you have everything setup, the main thing you need to try is to run your first Flutter app in an emulator. The complete guide is part of the official dev guide at [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive)

More specifically, you need to:

1. Create a sample Flutter project (use the current project from the previous step)
2. Run the emulator
3. Run the Flutter project

If everything works, you should be able to see the following screen in your emulator:

If you have the app up and running, congratulations! You have successfully setup everything you need to do Flutter. 

Get ready for more exciting development soon!
