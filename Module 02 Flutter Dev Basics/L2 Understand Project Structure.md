Mobile development has a lot of files to manage. Here are the major files and folders you need to know:

1. `lib` folder has all the Dart files, which you need to use very often
2. `pubspec.yaml` is the app configuration file, which manages the version, dependencies, and asset files
3. `android` folder contains all the generated files for Android, and ocassionally you need to touch it
4. `ios` folder contains all the generated files for iOS, and ocassionally you need to touch it

You spend most of the development time with 1 and 2. You don't need to change most of the other files.
