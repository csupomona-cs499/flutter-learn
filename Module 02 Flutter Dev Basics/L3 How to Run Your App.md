1. Green Arrow - Regular Run: this run the app for the first time - it takes more time and it starts from the beginning again
2. Yellow Icon - Hot Load: this is the fastest way to re-run the app to see the changes. It is almost instant, but sometimes it cannot load all the changes such as the additional dependencies or configurations
3. Stop and Green Arrow Run: this is to stop the app first, followed by running it from scratch. It takes most time, but it gives you a clean version that shows the complete changes.

Normally, you use Option 2 to run it. If things are not working, you can always try Option 1 and Option 3 to verify it.
